Over the last 4 years you would be hard-pressed to find a tool that has changed the industry more then Docker.  Docker has revolutionized the way providers deliver services and applications.  So what is this Docker?  What does everyone mean by containers?  Would it be beneficial for me or my team?  Does it take a degree in nuclear physics to use?  I haven't needed it before, why should I care now?  What is the maximum airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

In this session we will answer these questions and more as we explore what Docker is, what are the pro and cons of containers, where can we run them and what type of tools exist within this docker ecosystem.
